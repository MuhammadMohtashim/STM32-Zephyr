# Zephyr RTOS STM32 Examples - Making Embedded Development Accessible

Welcome to a collection of practical, beginner-friendly Zephyr RTOS examples designed specifically for STM32 microcontrollers. This repository was created with one simple goal: **making Zephyr RTOS more accessible to developers who want to dive into modern embedded development**.

## Why This Repository Exists

Zephyr RTOS is incredibly powerful, but getting started can feel overwhelming. The official documentation is comprehensive, but sometimes you just need working examples that you can build, flash, and see results immediately. That's exactly what this repository provides.

Whether you're coming from Arduino, bare-metal development, or other RTOS platforms, these examples are designed to get you productive with Zephyr quickly. Each project includes:

- **Complete, working code** that you can build and run immediately
- **Step-by-step instructions** for setup and deployment
- **Clear explanations** of what the code does and why
- **Porting guidance** for using the same concepts on different STM32 boards
- **Visual Studio Code integration** with the Zephyr extension

## What You'll Find Here

Currently, this repository includes:

### üìÅ [blackpill-i2c-scanner](./blackpill-i2c-scanner/)
A comprehensive I2C bus scanner for the STM32F411 BlackPill board. This project demonstrates:
- Basic Zephyr project structure
- I2C driver usage
- UART console output
- Device tree concepts
- Visual Studio Code development workflow

**Perfect for:** First-time Zephyr users, I2C debugging, understanding Zephyr fundamentals

## Roadmap - What's Coming Next

This repository is actively growing! Here's what you can expect:

### üöß Planned Examples
- **GPIO Control** - LED blinking, button handling, interrupt management
- **UART Communication** - Serial communication between devices
- **SPI Interface** - Working with SPI sensors and displays
- **PWM Generation** - Motor control and LED dimming
- **ADC Sampling** - Reading analog sensors
- **Timer Management** - Precise timing and scheduling
- **Sensor Integration** - Real-world examples with popular I2C/SPI sensors
- **Display Drivers** - OLED and LCD display control
- **Networking Examples** - When we move to boards with connectivity
- **Power Management** - Low-power operation techniques

### üîÑ Continuous Improvement
- **Code Quality**: Examples will be continuously refined based on community feedback
- **Documentation**: Instructions will be enhanced and clarified over time
- **Board Support**: Additional STM32 variants and development boards
- **Advanced Topics**: More complex examples as the foundation grows
- **Community Contributions**: Pull requests and suggestions are welcome!

## Who This Is For

- **Embedded developers** new to Zephyr RTOS
- **Arduino users** looking to step up to a professional RTOS
- **Students** learning modern embedded development
- **Makers and hobbyists** who want reliable, scalable code
- **Professional developers** needing quick Zephyr reference implementations
